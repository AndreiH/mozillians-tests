Running Tests
-------------

### Java
You will need a version of the [Java Runtime Environment][JRE] installed

[JRE]: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

### Python
Before you will be able to run these tests, you will need to have Python 2.6 installed (or a newer, stable version).

Run

    easy_install pip

followed by

    sudo pip install -r requirements/mozwebqa.txt

__note__

If you are running on Ubuntu/Debian you will need to do following first


    sudo apt-get install python-setuptools

to install the required Python libraries.

### Selenium
Once this is all set up, you will need to download and start a Selenium server. You can download the latest Selenium server from [here][Selenium Downloads]. The filename will be something like 'selenium-server-standalone-x.x.x.jar'

To start the Selenium server run the following command:

    java -jar ~/Downloads/selenium-server-standalone-x.x.x.jar

Change the path/name to the downloaded Selenium server file.

### Running tests locally

To run tests locally, it's a simple case of calling py.test from the Mozillians-tests directory
<br />You should specify the following argument for the Selenium rc: --api=rc
<br />The base URL should be a valid instance of mozillians-dev: --baseurl=http://mozillians-dev.allizom.org

    py.test --credentials=~/credentials.yaml

For other instructions type py.test --help .
